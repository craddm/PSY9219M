# Prison population 

Last week, we looked at some data regarding the UK's prison population.

The data is contained in an [Excel spreadsheet](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/676248/prison-population-data-tool-31-december-2017.xlsx), downloaded from [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk).

```{r read-pris, eval = FALSE}
library(readxl)
prison_pop <- read_excel("data/prison-population-data-tool-31-december-2017.xlsx",
                         sheet = "PT Data")
```

We use the **read_excel()** function to read Excel files.

Note how the file name and location come first, and then I specify a specific *sheet*.

Excel spreadsheets often have multiple sheets with different information.

# Prison population

Once the data is imported, we have a *tibble*.

We can immediately see there are 6 columns with 22409 rows.

```{r}
prison_pop
```

We need to do more work to make this file useable...

# Data transformation

With datasets like those we've loaded, there are often organisational issues. 

For example, there could be many columns or rows we don't need, or the data would make more sense if it were sorted.

This is where **dplyr** comes in!

|Function |Effect|
|------------|----|
| filter()   |Include or exclude observations (rows)|
| select()   |Include or exclude variables (columns)|
| mutate()   |Create new variables (columns)|
| summarise()|Aggregate or summarise groups of observations (rows)|
| arrange()  |Change the order of observations (rows)|

# Filtering rows

The `prison_pop` dataset has 22409 rows, but we don't need (or want) them all!

```{r}
unique(prison_pop$View)
```

The data is actually *repeated* four times, but organised differently each time.

```{r echo = FALSE}
prison_pop %>%
  group_by(View) %>%
  summarise(total_pop = sum(Population, na.rm = TRUE),
            num_entries = n())
```

# Filtering rows
If we just started investigating the data without accounting for this, it would be misleading.

.pull-left[
```{r warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(prison_pop, aes(x = Population)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(prison_pop, aes(x = Population)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) + facet_wrap(~View)
```
]

# Filtering rows

We can use the **filter()** function to select only the rows we're interested in, using *logical conditions* and *relational operators*.

```{r filter-pris}
filter(prison_pop,
       View == "a Establishment*Sex*Age Group")
```

---
# Relational operators

Relational operators compare two (or more) things and return a **logical** value (i.e. TRUE/FALSE)

|Operator|Meaning| Example|
|---|------------------| |
|>  | Greater than    |5 > 4|
|>= | Greater than or equal to| 4 >= 4|
|<  | Less than | Population < 400|
|<= | Less than or equal to | Population <= 400|
|== | Exactly equal to | Sex == "Male"| 
|!= | Not equal to | Establishment != "Ashfield"|
|%in%| Is contained in| Establishment %in% c("Bedford", "Oakwood")|

---
# Logical operators

Logical operators can be used to combine multiple relational operators or *negate* a relational operator.

|Operator| Meaning| Example|
|-|-|-|-|
|&| AND| Population < 1000 & Sex == "Male"|
|&#124;| OR| Population > 200 & Population < 500|
|!| NOT| !(Establishment %in% c("Bedford", "Oakwood")) |

# Filtering rows

We can have multiple *conditions* for selection with **filter()**.

Suppose we only wanted to include rows where Population is over 300 but under 600.

```{r filter-pris-two}
filter(prison_pop,
       View == "a Establishment*Sex*Age Group",
       Population > 300 & Population < 600)
```

# Selecting columns

Sometimes only some columns are of interest.

The Fear of Crime dataset has 169 columns. Only some of them are useful.

names(FearofCrime)[1:10]
```

# Selecting columns

Suppose that, first of all, we were only interested in the age and sex of our participants.

```{r age-and-sex}
select(FearofCrime, age, sex)
```

# Selecting columns

The HEXACO-PI-R is a personality questionnaire that aims to measure six factors - Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience.

The Fear of Crime dataset has the participants answers to the 60 questions of the HEXACO-PI-R in 60 columns. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
select(FearofCrime, hexaco1, hexaco2, hexaco3)
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
head(select(FearofCrime, hexaco1, hexaco2, hexaco3), 8)
```

# Selecting columns

Typing these out one by one would be ... *laborious*.

Fortunately, there are some shorthands.

The colon (*:*) operator can be used to say "everything between these columns (inclusive)".

```{r}
select(FearofCrime, hexaco1:hexaco5)
```

# Selecting columns

There are also several helper functions that can be used within **select()** (see the cheat sheet!).

**starts_with()** will select any column that starts with the string you supply:
```{r}
hex_only <- select(FearofCrime, starts_with("hexaco1"))
head(hex_only, 5)
```

# Selecting columns

Note that you can also tell **select()** to *remove* columns using the minus (*-*) sign.

Here I tell it to remove a few columns that have no useful information.

```{r}
FoC_removed <- select(FearofCrime, -ResponseSet, -Name,
                      -Status, -ExternalDataReference)
head(FoC_removed[, 1:7], 5)

# Mutating columns
Many psychometric tests calculate scores by adding up the responses across questions.

For example, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was collected in the Fear of Crime study.

The STAI is split into two parts of 20 questions, one for "state" anxiety (i.e. a person's generaly propensity towards anxiety), one for "trait" anxiety (i.e. how anxious a person is *right now*).

Although there are 20 items, for a demo I select the first 4 "state"" questions.

```{r}
FoC_stai <- select(FearofCrime, stai1:stai4)
FoC_stai <- mutate(FoC_stai, state_anxiety = stai1 + stai2 + stai3 + stai4)
FoC_stai["state_anxiety"]
```

# Summarising rows

**summarise()** takes data frame columns and summarises them. 

The authors of the Fear of Crime study helpfully also provide another version of their dataset that pre-calculates several of the measures.
```{r crime-head}
head(crime, 8)
```

# Summarising rows

.pull-left[
Here I calculate the mean, standard deviation, and variance of the State Anxiety variable. 

This is a simple way to create some basic summary statistics for a given data frame.

Other possible summmary functions (other than **mean()**, **sd()**, or **var()**) include **max()**, **min()**, **IQR()**, or **median()**.
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
summarise(crime,
          mean = mean(SA),
          standard_dev = sd(SA),
          variance = var(SA))
```

# Summarising rows

**summarise()** becomes much more useful when used with the **group_by()** function.

**group_by()** is used to organise data frames into groups according to categorical variables. 

```{r}
grouped_crime <- group_by(crime, sex, victim_crime)
summarise(grouped_crime,
          state_anxiety = mean(SA),
          sd_SA = sd(SA),
          var_SA = var(SA))
```

# Arranging rows

Sometimes we want to view data sorted by a specific field.

For example, suppose that we were looking at the prison population data and wanted to quickly see which was the largest prison population recorded.

```{r}
pris_filt <- filter(prison_pop,
                    View == "a Establishment*Sex*Age Group",
                    `Age / Custody / Nationality / Offence Group` == "Adults (21+)",
                    Sex == "Male")
head(arrange(pris_filt, Population), 5)
```

# Pipes

Often you want to conduct several steps, one after the other. 

You could do this using objects to store each intermediate step.
```{r}
temp_pris <- filter(prison_pop,
                    View == "a Establishment*Sex*Age Group",
                    Date == "2015-06")
temp_pris <- group_by(temp_pris,
                      Sex,
                      `Age / Custody / Nationality / Offence Group`)
temp_pris <- summarise(temp_pris,
                       mean_pop = mean(Population, na.rm = TRUE), 
                       median_pop = median(Population, na.rm = TRUE),
                       total_pop = sum(Population, na.rm = TRUE),
                       max_pop = max(Population, na.rm = TRUE))
```

# Pipes

A simpler way is to use *pipes* (**%>%**)

*pipes* can be read as meaning "AND THEN"

```{r}
prison_pop %>%
  filter(View == "a Establishment*Sex*Age Group",
         Date == "2015-06") %>%
  group_by(Sex, `Age / Custody / Nationality / Offence Group`) %>%
  summarise(mean_pop = mean(Population, na.rm = TRUE), 
            median_pop = median(Population, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_pop = sum(Population, na.rm = TRUE),
            max_pop = max(Population, na.rm = TRUE))
```
