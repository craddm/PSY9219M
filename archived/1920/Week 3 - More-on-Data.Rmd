# Writing R Scripts

Scripts are text documents that contain a sequence of commands to be executed sequentially.

A typical script looks something like this:
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Load in required packages using library()
library(tidyverse)

# Define any custom functions here (we haven't covered this!)

# Now load any data you want to work on. (again, we'll cover this later!)
test_data <- 
  read_csv("data/a-random-RT-file.csv") %>% # I'll explain what %>% means later
  rename(RT = `reaction times`)

# The rest of the script then runs whatever analyses or plotting you want to do
ggplot(test_data,
       aes(x = RT,
           fill = viewpoint)) + 
  geom_density()
```

# Basic data types

There are five basic data types in R:

```{r echo=FALSE}
examps <- data.frame(Type = c("integer", "numeric",
                              "character", "logical",
                              "complex"),
           Description = c("Whole numbers",
                           "Any real number, fractions",
                           "Text",
                           "Assertion of truth/falsity",
                           "Real and imaginary numbers"),
           Examples = c( "1, 2, 3",
                         "3.4, 2, -2.3",
                         "\"Hi there\", \"8.5\", \"ABC123\"",
                         "TRUE, FALSE",

knitr::kable(examps, format = "html")

# Containers

**Vectors** are one-dimensional collections of values of the same basic data type.

**Matrices** are two-dimensional collections of values of the same basic data type.

**Lists** are collections of objects of varying length and type.

**Data frames** are tables of data.

# Tidyverse

.large[

]

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # This loads all the tidyverse packages at once

.large[
You can also load each one individually. We'll be using the **tibble** package next.
]

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tibble)
```

.large[Many of the *tidyverse* packages create or output *tibbles*, which are essentially a more user-friendly version of data frames.]

---
# Tibbles

You can create a *tibble* similarly to how you create a data frame, using **tibble()**.

```{r}
age_tibb <- 
  tibble(Participant = 1:10, 
       cond1 = rnorm(10),
       age_group = rep(c("Old", "Young"), each = 5))
head(age_tibb)
```

# Tibbles
```{r eval = FALSE}
age_tibb <- 
  tibble(Participant = 1:10, 
       cond1 = rnorm(10),
*       age_group = rep(c("Old", "Young"), each = 5))
```

Here I used the **rep()** function to generate a character vector with the values "Old" and "Young".

```{r}
rep(c("Old", "Young"), each = 5)
rep(c("Old", "Young"), 5)
```

# Relating data to structure

# Let's think about an *experiment*

.large[
The experiment is a reaction time experiment with a two-by-two repeated measures design.

Participants see pictures of objects twice. Sometimes they are seen from the *same* viewpoint twice, sometimes from *different* viewpoints each time. 

There are two separate blocks of trials. 
The dependent variable is how long it takes them to name the objects, or *reaction time*.

You're interested in whether:

1. they get faster at naming object the second time

2. they are faster when the same view is presented both times.
]

---
# How many variables are there?

|Variables| R Data Type|
|--------------|------------|
|Participant ID|Numeric or character|
|Reaction times|Numeric|
|Block first/second|Character/factor|
|Viewpoint same/different|Character/factor|

.large[
The final dataset needs to be able to do several things.

1. It needs to uniquely identify each participant.

2. It needs to tie each value to the right participant.

3. It needs to identify what each value represents in terms of the design.

# Why Tidy?

.large[
1. Many functions in R operate on so-called *long* format data, requiring dependent and independent variables to be in different columns of a data frame.

2. Having a consistent way to store and structure your data makes it more *generic*. This makes it easier to use it with different functions.

3. Being *generic* also makes it easier to understand a new dataset in this format.

# Tidying your data

example_rt_df <- 
  tibble(Participant = seq(1, 10),
         Block1_same = rnorm(10, 500, 100),

         Block1_different = rnorm(10, 500, 100),
         Block2_different = rnorm(10, 400, 100))
```
The **tidyr** package contains functions to help tidy up your data.

We'll look now at **gather()** and **separate()**.

To start tidying our data, we need the RTs to be in a single column.

```{r}
head(example_rt_df, n = 4)
```

The function **gather()** can be used to combine columns into one.

Look at the help using **?gather**

---
# Step 1 - gather()

The syntax looks like this:

```{r eval = FALSE}
gather(data,
       key = "key",
       value = "value",
       ...)
```

The first argument, *data*, is the name of the data frame you want to modify.

*key* is the name of the new column that will contain the values of a single categorical variable.

*value* is the name of the new column containing the values for each level of that variable.

---
# Step 1 - gather()
```{r}
gather_rt <- 
  gather(example_rt_df,
         key = "exp_cond",
         value = "RT")
head(gather_rt)
```

But this isn't right! We need to tell it to leave the *Participant* column alone.

---
# Step 1 - gather()

After we specify the "key" and "value" columns, we need to specify which columns we want to be *gathered*.
.pull-left[
```{r}
gather_rt <- 
  gather(example_rt_df,
         key = "exp_cond",
         value = "RT",
         2:5)
head(gather_rt)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
gather_rt <- 
  gather(example_rt_df,
         key = "exp_cond",
         value = "RT",
         Block1_same:Block2_different)
head(gather_rt)
```
]

---
# Step 2 - separate()

We have the RTs in one column, but we still have another problem: 

The "Block" and "Viewpoint" variables are combined into a single column.

```{r}
head(gather_rt)
```

---
# Step 2 - separate()

Fortunately, the values in the *exp_cond* column can be easily split:
```{r}
unique(gather_rt$exp_cond)
```

The value of "Block" comes before the underscore ("_"), while the value of viewpoint comes after it.

We can use the **separate()** command split this into two columns.

Type **?separate()**

---
# Step 2 - separate()

Let's look at the syntax.
```{r eval = FALSE}
separate(data,
         col,
         into,
         sep, ...)
```

*Data* is the data frame you want to modify.

*col* is the name of column you want to separate.

*into* is the names of the new columns you want to create.

*sep* is the character that *separates* the values you want to split.

---
# Step 2 - separate()

```{r}
gather_rt <- 
  separate(gather_rt,
           col = "exp_cond",
           into = c("Block", "Viewpoint"),
           sep = "_")
head(gather_rt)
```

---
# Your target

.pull-left[
```{r echo = FALSE}
head(example_rt_df %>%
  tidyr::gather("exp_cond",
"RT",
-Participant) %>%
  tidyr::separate(exp_cond,
                  c("Block", "Viewpoint")), 15)
  #DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 3)) %>% DT::formatRound(2:5)
```
]
.pull-right[
## Step 1 - **gather()** the RTs

## Step 2 - **separate()** the variables
]

---
# Splitting columns up

Sometimes you want to go in the *opposite* direction. 

**spread()** is the *opposite* of **gather()**. 

```{r}
spread_rt <- 
  spread(gather_rt,
       Block,
       RT)
head(spread_rt, 10)
```

---
# Combining columns into one


.pull-left[
We used **separate()** to split up our "exp_cond" column.

We can use **unite()** to put it back together.
```{r}
united_rt <- 
  unite(gather_rt,
      exp_cond, # the name of the new column
      Block,
      Viewpoint,
      sep = "_")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}

# Now that it's tidy...

```{r quick-summ, echo = FALSE}
gather_rt %>%
