# What is R?
.large[
R is a statistical, mathematical programming language

* Created in 1993

* Designed from the ground up to support many statistical tasks

* Covers all aspects of data analysis from import through to production of reports

* Free, open source
    * Can be downloaded from the [R-project](https://r-project.org) website

* Continually evolving
    * R has over 12,000 *packages* that add additional functions

# Scenario A
.large[
You've just started work in a psychology lab. You're asked to help analyse some old data. There is reaction time data from 50 participants. Each participant's data is stored in a separate text file.

- How do you combine the data from each participant together to be able to analyse the data?

- It turns out some of the participants only completed part of the experiment - which ones, and what should you do with their data?

- What steps should you take to select and perform appropriate statistical analysis?
]


---

# Scenario B

.large[
You've been asked to design, implement, and evaluate a new treatment regime across several psychiatric institutes. Several colleagues are skeptical that it can deliver the kind of improvements in outcomes indicated in a publication describing the method.

- How do you interpret the strength of the previously published evidence?

- How do you design a rigorous test of the treatment efficacy?

- How do you evaluate and report on the outcomes of your trial?

# How to use R

* The R Console

    * REPL: Read/Evaluate/Print/Loop
    
    * Type stuff in, it tries to do it

When you see the **>** symbol - 

```{r eval = FALSE}
*>
```

... R is waiting for your input.

```{r eval = FALSE}
> 5 
[1] 5
```

---

# Warming up

Try using R like a calculator!

### Basic arithmetic operators

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(data.frame(Symbol = c("+",
                                   "-",
                                   "*",
                                   "/",
                                   "^",
                                   "%%"),
                        Operation = c("addition",
                                      "subtraction",
                                      "multiplication",
                                      "division",
                                      "exponentiation",
                                      "modulo")),
             format = "markdown")
```

---

# Warming up

You can break up long maths expressions over multiple lines:

```{r basic_calc}
2 + 4 + 5 + 
  5 + 6 + 7 + 8 +
  10
```

Note that when you do that, the ">" symbol changes to a "+"

```{r eval = FALSE}
> 5 +
*+ 5
[1] 10
```

---

# Remember!

.large[**>** means R is waiting for input.]

```{r eval = FALSE}
>
```

.large[**+** means R is waiting for you to finish your command.]

```{r eval = FALSE}
+
```

Either finish your command, or press the **Esc** key to cancel it.

---

# Text input

R can also accept text strings as input.

```{r eval = FALSE}
"hello world!"
[1] "hello world!"
```

You need to use quotation marks ("") to tell R that this is text:

```{r error = TRUE}
hello world!
```

Otherwise, you'll receive an error like the one above.

---
# Why is there an error?

In R, you can assign values to an **object** for subsequent use. **Objects** have names that are written as text.

The assignment operator is the two-character symbol:
```{r eval = FALSE}
*<-
```

You assign values to objects by putting the **<-** sign between the name of the object and the value you want to give it:

```{r}
example <- 5
example
```

Note that R does not immediately provide output when you assign the output to an object. 

---
# The assignment operator

.large[Think of **<-** as meaning "is now". i.e.

```{r}
example <- 5
```
can be read as 
```{r eval = FALSE}
The object "example" is now 5
```
]

---

# Working with objects

Once an object is assigned, the name that you gave it *stands in* for the *value* that you assigned to it, and can be used as if it were that value:

```{r}
example
example + 10 
example + 13 - 1 * 2 %% 4
```

# Try it out!

---
# Try a few things out!

1. Assign some values to objects using the assignment operator (**<-**)

2. Try using arithmetic operations (e.g. *, /, %%) on those objects

3. Try using arithmetic operations to combine multiple numerical objects

4. Try using arithmetic operations on text

---
# Combining multiple things

Sometimes you want to allocate more than one value to an object.

You can use the **c()** function to do this.

```{r}
c(8, 5, 10)
example <- c(8, 5, 10)
example
```
```{r}
c("hello", "how", "are", "you")
```

## IMPORTANT: BRACKETS () AFTER A WORD MEAN THAT THIS IS A **FUNCTION** 

---
# Vectors

The function **c()** is creating **vectors**.

Vectors are simply a one-dimensional collection of things that all have the same *type* (we will cover data types next week!).

Note that mixing, for example, text and numbers, will yield a *character* vector.

```{r}
c(5, "five", 2)
```

---
# Functions

Functions are commands that operate on **objects**.

For example, to calculate the *mean* of several numbers, you can use the function **mean()**. The output of functions can also be assigned to **objects** using **<-**.

```{r}
mean(c(8, 5, 10))
example <- c(8, 5, 10)
mean(example)
example_mean <- mean(example)
example_mean
```

---
# Try it out!

1. Use **c()** to create a vector of numbers.

2. Use **c()** to create a vector of strings.

3. Calculate the **mean()** of a vector of numbers.

4. Try guessing some other simple statistics (e.g. other types of *average*) that you can use.

# Getting help 

If you don't know how to use a function, R has built-in help! 

There are several ways you can access it:

```{r eval = FALSE}
help("mean")
?mean
??mean
```

---
# Packages

Packages are the key to R's versatility. Over 12000 are currently available from the **Comprehensive R Archive Network** - [CRAN](https::https://cran.r-project.org/). The **install.packages()** function can be used to install packages.

Let's install the "cowsay" package. **cowsay** is an extraordinarily useful package, as you'll see.

One way to install the package is using the console:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("cowsay")
```

Once it's installed, use the **library()** function to load the package!

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(cowsay)
```

But **another** way to install is using the GUI!

# Try out the **cowsay** package

**cowsay** adds a function called **say()**. Load the function in as follows, and look at the help for **say()**.
```{r echo = FALSE}
library(cowsay)
```
```{r eval = FALSE}
library(cowsay)
?say()
```

.left-pull[
Remember that help appears in the bottom right window!

Look at **Usage** and **Arguments**

**Usage** is how to use the function.

**Arguments** are what the functions expect and understand.
]

---

```{r}
say(what = "Feed me, human.", by = "cat")
```

---
# Try out the say() function

1. Try a few different animals by changing the **by** argument

2. Change what the animals say by changing the **what** argument.

3. Assign the output to an object using the **<-** operator.

4. Print out the value that you assigned to the object.
