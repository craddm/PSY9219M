# Basic use of R

## Use of R like a calculator

The R console allows you to use it like a calculator, as below:

```{r}
5 + 5
10 - 6 * 13
```

---
# Basic use of R
## Creating objects to store information

You assign values to objects using *<-*
```{r obj-assign}
test_object <- 5
```

*<-* can be read as "is now", making the code above roughly mean

```{r eval = FALSE} 
The object "test_object" is now 5 # Do not run!
```

Objects "stand-in" for their values:

```{r}
test_object
```

---
# Basic use of R
## Creation of vectors
Vectors are simply a 1-dimensional collection of values of the same type. 

E.g. We can create a numeric vector using the **c()** function.

```{r create-vec}
c(5, 10, 3, -1, -5)
```

This is a one-dimensional vector of length *five*, since it has 5 values.

---
# Basic use of R
## Using functions on objects

**Functions** do things to objects. 

Brackets after a word in these slides indicate that something is a function, e.g. **c()**, **mean()**
```{r get-mean}
mean(c(5, 8, 2, 4, 5))
test_object <- c(5, 8, 2, 4, 5)
mean(test_object)
```

# R Scripts

---
# R Scripts

*Scripts* are a way of writing out a sequence of commands that you want R to execute.

A typical script looks something like this:
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Load in required packages using library()
library(tidyverse)

# Define any custom functions here (we haven't covered this!)

# Now load any data you want to work on. (again, we'll cover this later!)
test_data <- 
  read_csv("data/a-random-RT-file.csv") %>% # I'll explain what %>% means later
  rename(RT = `reaction times`)

# The rest of the script then runs whatever analyses or plotting you want to do
ggplot(test_data,
       aes(x = RT,
           fill = viewpoint)) + 
  geom_density()
```

---
# Why is this useful?

.large[
Somebody asks you how you performed a particular analysis. In particular, they want detailed instructions of how you created a plot, filtered out outliers or missing data, and performed a linear regression.

Q1: *How would you do that if you used SPSS?*

Q2: *How would you do that if you used R?*

# R Markdown

.large[
**Literate programming** is a mixture of plain text and code.

Whereas in scripts you need to use the **#** symbol to indicate comments, as here

```{r eval = FALSE}
# This is a comment
```

...with R Markdown you can mix plain text and code using **chunks** to delineate sections of code. 

This allows you to create elaborate documents following the structure *you* want!

# Some very important advice

R Markdown documents are like *recipes*. 

Every step needs to be written down.

When you press the knit button, R forgets everything and follows the instructions line-by-line. 

So be thorough, and write down everything in the order you want it to happen!

(One exception: NEVER use install.packages() in a script)

#Basic data types

# Basic data types

There are five basic data types in R:

```{r echo=FALSE}
examps <- data.frame(Type = c("integer", "numeric", "character", "logical", "complex"),
           Description = c("Whole numbers", "Any real number, fractions", "Text", "Assertion of truth/falsity", "Real and imaginary numbers"),
           Examples = c( "1, 2, 3", "3.4, 2, -2.3", "\"Hi there\", \"8.5\", \"ABC123\"","TRUE, FALSE", complex(real =.34, imaginary = 5.3)))
knitr::kable(examps, format = "html")
```

There are some additional types to be aware of, particularly *factors*, but we'll come back to them in a later session.

---
# Checking data types

We can use the **class()** function to check what type a given object is.

```{r}
class(10)
class(10L) # using L after the number turns it into an *integer*
class(TRUE)
class("Wednesday")
```

# Vectors

A vector is a collection of values which all have the same basic **type**.

A numeric vector is thus a collection of numeric values:

```{r}
some_numbers <- c(5, 3, 6, 8)
some_numbers
```
... and a character vector is a collection of character values

```{r}
char_example <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday")
char_example
```

---
# More about vectors

The colon (**:**) operator can be used to produce a sequence of numbers:

```{r}
one_to_ten <- 1:10
one_to_ten
```

Vectors can also be given names:

```{r}
one_to_four <- 1:4
names(one_to_four) <- char_example
one_to_four
```

---
# Extracting values 

Sometimes you only want a specific subset of a vector. For example, suppose that you only want the third value. For this, we need the **[]** (square brackets) operator.

We put an *index* inbetween the **[]** operator.

```{r}
char_example[3]
```

Note that you can also supply *multiple* values:
```{r}
char_example[2:3]
char_example[c(2, 4)]
```

---
# Extracting values 

If your vector is *named*, you can also use the names as *indices*.

```{r}
one_to_four
one_to_four["Wednesday"]
one_to_four[c("Monday", "Wednesday")]
```

# Matrices

---
# Matrices

Matrices are 2-dimensional collections of values.

All values must be of the same type.

```{r}
matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
```

This is quite a common format. For example, each row could represent an individual participant. Each column could represent a different numerical measure.

---
# Accessing matrices

Since matrices are two-dimensional, you need to give two indices to make sure you get the value you want. Again, you can use the **[]** operator.

```{r eval = FALSE}
*[row, col]
```

Here I extract the number from the 2nd row down, 3rd column across.

```{r}
test_matrix <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
test_matrix
test_matrix[2, 3]
```

# Lists

---
# Lists

Lists are a collection of objects of varying length and type. 

```{r}
album_list <-
  list(The_Beatles = c(
    "Sgt. Pepper",
    "The White Album",
    "Revolver",
    "Abbey Road"),
    Nirvana = c(
      "Bleach",
      "Nevermind",
      "In Utero")
    )
```

Each element is labelled, just like a mason jar on a shelf.

Each element has different contents, just like our mason jars.

---
# Lists

```{r}
names(album_list)
length(album_list)
```

```{r}
album_list["The_Beatles"]
```

---
# Tabular data

*Tabular* data is also collection of different types of data, arranged in a rectangular, tabular format. Most of the data you encounter in psychology is in this kind of format.

In tabular data, each column contains only values of one *type*, and each row thus contains different types of information about one thing. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
DT::datatable(mtcars[, 1:5], options = list(pageLength = 5))
```

# Creating tabular data

In R, this type of structure is called a *data frame*.
.pull-left[
```{r}
days_of_the_week <- 
  data.frame(day_name = c("Sunday",
                          "Monday",
                          "Tuesday",
                          "Wednesday",
                          "Thursday",
                          "Friday",
                          "Saturday"),
             day_number = 1:7
             )

```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
days_of_the_week
```
]

---
# Extracting information from data frames

You can use the **[]** operator to extract single elements, rows, or columns:

```{r}
days_of_the_week[1, 2]
```

```{r}
days_of_the_week[5, ]
```

```{r}
days_of_the_week[, 1]
```

---
# Extracting information from data frames

A special operator you can use for data frame columns is the dollar sign, **$**

Combine the data frame's name with the column name as below:

```{r}
days_of_the_week$day_name
```

Question: what **class()** is this?

## Prep for next week

.large[
- Next week we'll talk again about data frames and consider how to *structure* data.

- Look at Section 2 (Wrangle) of R4DS for information on **tibbles** (which are essentially data frames...).
