# Writing R Scripts

Scripts are text documents that contain a sequence of commands to be executed sequentially.

A typical script looks something like this:
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Load in required packages using library()
library(tidyverse)

# Define any custom functions here (we haven't covered this!)

# Now load any data you want to work on. (again, we'll cover this later!)
test_data <- 
  read_csv("data/a-random-RT-file.csv") %>% # I'll explain what %>% means later
  rename(RT = `reaction times`)

# The rest of the script then runs whatever analyses or plotting you want to do
ggplot(test_data,
       aes(x = RT,
           fill = viewpoint)) + 
  geom_density()
```

RMarkdown documents contain a mixture of code and plain text.

They can be used to produce *reports* and fully formatted documents with whatever structure you choose.

# Basic data types

There are five basic data types in R:

```{r echo=FALSE}
examps <- 
  data.frame(Type = c("double", "integer", "numeric", "character", "logical"),
           Description = c("Floating point value", "Integer", "Any real number", "Text", "Assertion of truth/falsity"),
           Examples = c("3.12", "1, 2, 3", "3.4, 2, -2.3", "\"Hi there\", \"8.5\", \"ABC123\"","TRUE, FALSE" ))
knitr::kable(examps, format = "html")
```

---
# Containers

**Vectors** are one-dimensional collections of values of the same basic data type.

**Matrices** are two-dimensional collections of values of the same basic data type.

**Lists** are collections of objects of varying length and type.

**Data frames** are tables of data.

# Accessing elements from containers

You can use the **[]** operator after the name of an object to extract indvidual elements from that object.

```{r echo = FALSE}
album_list <-

    "The White Album",

# Relating data to structure

---
# Example data frames

R has a number of example data frames built-in.

```{r eval = FALSE}
data()
help("ChickWeight")
head(ChickWeight)
```

You can these to get an idea of the kind of ways data is structured by R.

(Note here I use the **head()** function to see the first 6 rows of the data frame "ChickWeight")


---
# Example data frames

```{r}
head(ChickWeight, n = 10)
```

*ChickWeight* has 578 datapoints from an experiment on effects of diet on early growth of chicks.

Each column is a separate *variable*, with different information.

---
# Scenario A
.large[
You've just started work in a psychology lab. You're asked to help analyse some old data. There is reaction time data from 50 participants. Each participant's data is stored in a separate text file.

- How do you combine the data from each participant together to be able to analyse the data?

- It turns out some of the participants only completed part of the experiment - which ones, and what should you do with their data?

- What steps should you take to select and perform appropriate statistical analysis?
]

---
# Let's think about the *experiment*

.large[
The experiment is a reaction time experiment with a two-by-two repeated measures design.

Participants see pictures of objects twice. Sometimes they are seen from the *same* viewpoint twice, sometimes from *different* viewpoints each time. 

There are two separate blocks of trials. 
The dependent variable is how long it takes them to name the objects, or *reaction time*.

You're interested in 1) whether they get faster the second time, and 2) whether they faster when the same view is presented both times.
]

---
# How the design informs the structure

.pull-left[
|Variables|
|--------------|
|Participant ID|
|Reaction times|
|Block first/second|
|Viewpoint same/different|
]
.pull-right[
| R Data Type|
|------------|
|Numeric or character|
|Numeric|
|Character/factor|
|Character/factor|
]  
    
The final dataset needs to be able to do several things.

1. It needs to uniquely identify each participant.

2. It needs to tie each value to the right participant.

3. It needs to identify what each value represents in terms of the design.

# Create a data frame

## Your task:

.large[
1. Create a data frame with one column per condition.

2. Each row should be for one participant.

3. Each row should have an identifier for the participant, with the identifiers in one column.
]

---
# Create a data frame

## Some helpful functions

- **rnorm()** 
    - Use **rnorm()** to generate a normally distributed set of numbers.
    - Type ?rnorm in console for help
    - **rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)**
```{r eval = FALSE}
rnorm(100, 500, 100) # This creates a vector of 100 values 
      #with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100
```

- **data.frame()**
  - Create columns in a data frame
  - **data.frame(colname = values)**
  - Separate columns with a comma ","
```{r eval = FALSE}
data.frame(col_one = rnorm(...),
           col_two = rnorm(...))
```
---
# Create a data frame

## Tips
- Remember to *assign* output to an object using the **<-** operator.

- You can create a sequential vector using the colon (**:**) operator (e.g. 1:5) or the **seq()** function (type ?seq)

- Remember that objects can *stand in* for their values
```{r eval = FALSE}
some_rts <- rnorm(23, 34, 50)
test_df <-
  data.frame(col_one = some_rts,
             col_two = rnorm(...),
             ...)
```

- Once you've created a data frame, try calculating the **mean()** and **sd()** of the columns

# Tidyverse

.large[

]

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # This loads all the tidyverse packages at once
```

.large[
You can also load each one individually. We'll be using the **tibble** package next.
]

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tibble)
```

.large[Many of the *tidyverse* packages convert or output *tibbles*, which are essentially a more user-friendly version of data frames.]

---
# Tibbles

*Tibbles* directly show what *data type* is stored in each column.

You can convert a data frame to a *tibble* using the **as_tibble()** function.

```{r conv-tibb}
example_rt_tibble <- as_tibble(example_rt_df)
head(example_rt_tibble)
```

---
# Tibbles

You can create a *tibble* similarly to how you create a data frame, using **tibble()**.

```{r}
age_tibb <- 
  tibble(Participant = 1:10, 
       cond1 = rnorm(10),
       age_group = rep(c("Old", "Young"), each = 5))
head(age_tibb)
```

---
# Tibbles
```{r eval = FALSE}
age_tibb <- 
  tibble(Participant = 1:10, 
       cond1 = rnorm(10),
*       age_group = rep(c("Old", "Young"), each = 5))
```

Here I used the **rep()** function to generate a character vector with the values "Old" and "Young".

```{r}
rep(c("Old", "Young"), each = 5)
rep(c("Old", "Young"), 5)
```

# Why Tidy?

.large[
1. Many functions in R operate on so-called *long* format data, requiring dependent and independent variables to be in different columns of a data frame.

2. Having a consistent way to store and structure your data makes it more *generic*. This makes it easier to use it with different functions.

3. Being *generic* also makes it easier to understand a new dataset in this format.
]

---
# A Tidy Structure

```{r echo = FALSE}
head(example_rt_df %>%
  tidyr::gather("exp_cond",
"RT",
-Participant) %>%
  tidyr::separate(exp_cond,
                  c("Block", "Viewpoint")), 15) #%>% 
  #DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 7)) %>% DT::formatRound(2:5)
```

---
# Tidyr

The **tidyr** package contains functions to help tidy up your data.

We'll look now at **gather()** and **separate()**.

To start tidying our data, we need the RTs to be in a single column.

```{r}
head(example_rt_df, n = 4)
```

The function **gather()** can be used to combine columns into one.

Look at the help using **?gather**


---
# Step 1 - gather()

The syntax looks like this:

```{r eval = FALSE}
gather(data,
       key = "key",
       value = "value",
       ...)
```

The first argument, *data*, is the name of the data frame you want to modify.

*key* is the name of the new column that will contain the values of a single categorical variable.

*value* is the name of the new column containing the values for each level of that variable.

---
# Step 1 - gather()
```{r}
gather_rt <- 
  gather(example_rt_df,
         key = "exp_cond",
         value = "RT")
head(gather_rt)
```

But this isn't right! We need to tell it to leave the *Participant* column alone.

---
# Step 1 - gather()

After we specify the "key" and "value" columns, we need to specify which columns we want to be *gathered*.
.pull-left[
```{r}
gather_rt <- 
  gather(example_rt_df,
         key = "exp_cond",
         value = "RT",
         2:5)
head(gather_rt)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
gather_rt <- 
  gather(example_rt_df,
         key = "exp_cond",
         value = "RT",
         Block1_same:Block2_different)
head(gather_rt)
```
]

---
# Step 2 - separate()

We have the RTs in one column, but we still have another problem: 

The "Block" and "Viewpoint" variables are combined into a single column.

```{r}
head(gather_rt)
```

---
# Step 2 - separate()

Fortunately, the values in the *exp_cond* column can be easily split:
```{r}
unique(gather_rt$exp_cond)
```

The value of "Block" comes before the underscore ("_"), while the value of viewpoint comes after it.

We can use the **separate()** command split this into two columns.

Type **?separate()**


---
# Step 2 - separate()

Let's look at the syntax.
```{r eval = FALSE}
separate(data,
         col,
         into,
         sep, ...)
```

*Data* is the data frame you want to modify.

*col* is the name of column you want to separate.

*into* is the names of the new columns you want to create.

*sep* is the character that *separates* the values you want to split.

---
# Step 2 - separate()

```{r}
gather_rt <- 
  separate(gather_rt,
           col = "exp_cond",
           into = c("Block", "Viewpoint"),
           sep = "_")
head(gather_rt)
```

---
# Your target

```{r echo = FALSE}
head(example_rt_df %>%
  tidyr::gather("exp_cond",
"RT",
-Participant) %>%
  tidyr::separate(exp_cond,
                  c("Block", "Viewpoint")), 15)
  #DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 7)) %>% DT::formatRound(2:5)
```

---
# Your target
```{r echo = FALSE}

                  c("Block", "Viewpoint")), 8)
  #DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 3)) %>% DT::formatRound(2:5)
```

## Step 1 - **gather()** the RTs

## Step 2 - **separate()** the variables

# Now what?

# Now that it's tidy...

Now that we've got the data in a tidy format, we can begin to use some of the more interesting features of R!

We can produce a boxplot using **ggplot2** (more next week!)
.pull-left[
```{r quick-box, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(gather_rt) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = Viewpoint,
                             y = RT)) +
  facet_wrap(~Block)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r quick-dens, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(gather_rt) + 
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = RT,
                             fill = Viewpoint), alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~Block) + theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
```
]

---
# Now that it's tidy...

We can produce some summary statistics using **dplyr** (more soon!)

```{r quick-summ, echo = FALSE}
gather_rt %>%
  group_by(Block, Viewpoint) %>%
  summarise(mean_RT = mean(RT), sd_RT = sd(RT))

# Now that it's tidy...

We can run ANOVA with **afex**.

```{r echo = FALSE}

             id = "Participant",
             data = gather_rt)
```

# Now that it's tidy...

We can create interaction plots using **emmeans**.
